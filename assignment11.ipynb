    "Consider the reservoir shown below with the given properties that has been discretized into 4 equal grid blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a skeleton of a Python class that can be used to solve for the pressures in the reservoir.  The class is actually written generally enough that it can account for an arbitrary number of grid blocks, but we will only test cases with 4.  The class takes a Python dictonary of input parameters as an initialization argument.  An example of a complete set of input parameters is shown in the `setup()` function of the tests below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several simple useful functions are already implemented, your task is to implement the functions `compute_transmisibility()`, `compute_accumulation()`, `fill_matrices()` and `solve_one_step()`.  `fill_matrices()` should correctly populate the $\\mathbf{T}$, $\\mathbf{B}$ matrices as well as the vector $\\vec{Q}$.   These should also correctly account for the application of boundary conditions.  Only the boundary conditions shown in the figure will be tested, but in preparation for future assignments, you may wish to add the logic to the code such that arbitrary pressure/no flow boundary conditions can be applied to either side of the one-dimensional reservoir. You may need to use the `'conversion factor'` for the transmissibilities. `solve_one_step()` should solve a single time step for either the explicit or implicit methods depending on which is specified in the input parameters. The $\\vec{p}{}^{n+1}$ values should be stored in the class attribute `self.p`.  If this is implemented correctly, you will be able to then use the `solve()` function to solve the problem up to the `'number of time steps'` value in the input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, in preparation for solving much larger systems of equations in the future, use the `scipy.sparse` module to create sparse matrix data structures for $\\mathbf{T}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$.  The sparsity of the matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ is tested, so please assign this matrix to a class attribute named exactly `T`.  Use `scipy.sparse.linalg.cg()` for the linear solution of the `'implicit'` method implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the tests passing, you might like to experiment with viewing several plots with different time steps, explicit vs. implicit, number of grid blocks, etc.  To assist in giving you a feel for how they change the character of the approximate solution.  I have implemented a simple plot function that might help for this."
